  <h1>To My Soulmate, My sunflower. </h1>
  <p>I had been playing fortnite for a while. And i had just joined some discord servers to make friends on the game. I usually played solo queue, but for some reason I decided to ask some people to play.<br>
<br>

Shan responded, and told me her friend eggyolked would join.<br>
<br>


That's when I met the love of my life. Kimmy. Egghead, eggyolked, awildhoney. Playing was fun, and I thought of texting her, but then she texted me. A casual meet up turned into daily texts. <br><br>

<br>
<br>

We got to know each other, and I fell in love with this girl. From her excitement of DND, to playing a silly brick game on fortnite. 
<br>
<br>

Rereading these messages makes me daydream. The excitement, the honest and genuine interest and love. It was so natural.
<br>
<br>

The sexual attraction- Yes, we sexted and thinking back, i still feel the butterflies. We entered a relationship so fast, but it felt so right. That was 9 months ago.
<br>
<br>

The more I knew you, the more i fell in love. Even when I left for Japan, we bonded so well when I got back. We left each other voice notes, we called, we were each others person.
<br>
<br>

I remember random moments.<br>

When we were playing reload, and I was knocked down and you clutched up by killing 2 people and I felt so proud.
<br>
<br>

When in murder mystery we were hiding under the stairs together and i then surprise killed you.
<br>
<br>

When I failed my exam and you comforted me.
<br>
<br>

Hearing your voice for the first time, hearing how giggly you were.
<br>
<br>

How i felt when i first heard you told me you loved me.
<br>
<br>

The way I feel when i fall asleep with you on the call.
<br>
<br>

Reading you dutch to fall asleep.
<br>
<br>

Bonding over similar interests like hxh.
<br>
<br>

Watching brittany on youtube together. All the shows and movies we are supposed to watch together.
<br>
<br>

Planning vancouver.
<br>
<br>

Playing that roblox game where we had to climb all the way up.
<br>
<br>

Your cute lisp, i know you are insecure but I love your voice.
<br>
<br>

How I never met anyone with the same music taste with me. I love our jams.<br><br>
    <img src="IMG_2222.png" width="510px"><br><br>

I can go on and on, about how much I love you, how beautiful, amazing you are. How i stare at your selfies, how i day dream about meeting you, how i would do anything for you, love you eternally. The way you motivate me for life, but it shouldnt have taken you doubting our relationship to show you that.
<br>
<br>

Kimmy.<br>

I love you. I dont know why I am making this. Probably hoping you realize that you are my entire world. And trying to recreate that spark.
<br>
<br>

But i feel like not talking, will make you realize you dont need me or want me anymore.
<br>
<br>

I just want you to remember the good and bad times. <br>

I made so many mistakes, I am in no way perfect. But lord. I will always try and be better for you.
<br>
<br>
I realize that somewhere along the lines I became numb, and less affectionate. Maybe you felt it, and our lack of comversations led you into a mindset of lide without me. I understand that. But please, allow me the chance to be your person again. Show you effort, show you I want to be here. We been talking for alomst 10 months- I dont want to lose that. Not when you mean so much to me.

All these ideas for a break, and taking time.. I want you to take your time. But I have to be honest too-
<br>
<br>

I am in love. I only have eyes for you. I was so ready to move to canada if we met and everything went well after my studies. I want this to be real.
<br>
<br>

Yes, we met on fortnite. But what we have is so special. And I cant help but beg- Please come back to me. Choose me. Choose our love and working on it. I understand my wrongdoings- I understand a relationship takes eternal effort. And I cant just climb in a shell.
<br>
<br>

I propose.<br>

Lets stay in a relationship, work on this.<br>

And you take a break. Love yourself, take care of yourself. I will stay strong for us, while you gain back your energy and rest up. Youre tired. And thats okay. You can lean on me, and I will hold you, take care of you, till you can stand on your own 2 feet again.</p>
  <p>I love you and I hope you accept my unwavering affection. Hoping that your sweet sweet heart would forgive me, and choose me. And grow through this difficult period.</p>
  <p><span class="heart">&hearts;</span></p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <p>Your Sully</p>
